## Introduction

Do you like Data Visualization and `#Rstats`? 

Base graphics in R is a powerful, blazing fast, and offers extremely customization data visualization solutions. Unfortunately, in the world of `ggplot2`, base graphics is largely ignored due to lack proper documentations and howtos.

This repository demonstrates the usage of base R graphics (along with code and datasets) to generate visually appealing plots, without any dependencies what so ever.

This repository is for those who like to learn and customize base R plotting functions. `#BaseisBeautiful` :)
