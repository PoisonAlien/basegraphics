## Introduction

Base graphics in `R` is extremely powerful, blazing fast, and offers extremely customization data visualization solutions. Unfortunately, in the world of `ggplot2`, base graphics is largely ignored due to lack proper documentations and howtos.

This document demonstrates the usage of base `R` graphics to generate visually appealing plots, without any dependencies.


I also tweet plots [@baseRgraphics](https://twitter.com/baseRgraphics). Make sure to follow the account for updates :)
